# PalindromeTipper
Solver for the Palindrome tip problem (make the tip and total palindromic numbers). I'm using this as my sample project to get some tools going and start to get back into some regular coding. I may try to make it into a native app and/or add other intertesting tip tricks (like ascending or desceding numbers, lots of zeros/ones etc.

This is the MVP version. I'm using it to get my dev environment set up and to work with github. See the hosted github page to see it work: (https://tconfrey.github.io/PalindromeTipper/) .
